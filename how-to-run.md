1. unzip `apps.tsv.zip` under the same folder
2. run `notebook` and then open `project.ipynb` to run
3. In `project.ipynb`, we can set `one_time_run = True` otherwise the code will run 5-fold cross validation which is time-consuming. For `run_nmtf` method, it is slow so need some time to wait for 50 iterations.
